# End-to-End_Healthcare_Data_Engineering_Pipeline
An end-to-end ETL pipeline built with Apache Airflow and PostgreSQL. The pipeline extracts healthcare data from local storage, transforms it using Pandas, and loads the cleaned data into PostgreSQL. This project demonstrates core data engineering concepts including ETL design, task orchestration, and database integration.
